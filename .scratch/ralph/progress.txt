## Codebase Patterns
- Vue 3 composables pattern for state management (useAuth composable)
- API requests from frontend include auth headers via composables
- Component structure: views/ for full page components, composables/ for shared logic, layouts/ for layout components
- LocalStorage used for persisting authentication state
- Responsive design patterns: mobile-first with flex layouts and viewport detection
- Sidebar pattern: responsive sidebar with desktop width (250px) and mobile collapse toggle

## Sun Jan 25 03:51:00 UTC 2026 - US-006
- Implemented POST /file/:path endpoint to save markdown file content
- Endpoint accepts { content: string } in request body
- Returns { success: true, path: string } on success
- Includes proper path validation to prevent directory traversal (prevents .. in paths)
- Creates parent directories automatically using fs.mkdirSync with recursive flag
- Files changed: editor-server.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Path validation must check for '..' and use path.resolve() to ensure resolved path stays within BLOG_DIR
  - fs.mkdirSync with recursive: true safely creates nested directories
  - Both GET and POST endpoints should have identical path validation logic for consistency
  - Error responses follow consistent { success: false, error: string } format

## Sun Jan 25 - US-007
- Initialized Vue 3 + TypeScript frontend project in /editor folder
- Created Vite project structure with proper TypeScript configuration (strict mode enabled)
- Configured vite.config.ts to:
  - Proxy /api/* requests to http://localhost:3001
  - Serve on port 5173
- Created basic App.vue component with placeholder message
- Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode and ES2020 target
- Files created:
  - editor/package.json (Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript dependencies)
  - editor/vite.config.ts (proxy configuration)
  - editor/tsconfig.json (strict TypeScript)
  - editor/src/main.ts (Vue app entry)
  - editor/src/App.vue (placeholder component)
  - editor/src/env.d.ts (Vue type definitions)
  - editor/index.html (HTML entry point)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vue 3 + Vite project structure requires env.d.ts for proper .vue module typing
  - Vite proxy configuration in server.proxy works with target URL
  - TypeScript strict mode in editor requires proper vue-tsc setup
  - The editor is a separate npm package in /editor subdirectory

## Sun Jan 25 - US-008
- Created LoginView.vue component with password input and submit button
- Implemented useAuth composable for managing authentication state
- Features:
  - Password input field with loading state feedback
  - Error message display for failed authentication
  - LocalStorage persistence of password
  - API call to POST /api/auth with password
  - Success/failure handling
- Updated App.vue to conditionally render LoginView or editor content based on auth state
- Files created:
  - editor/src/composables/useAuth.ts (auth state management)
  - editor/src/views/LoginView.vue (login UI)
- Files modified:
  - editor/src/App.vue (conditional rendering)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vue 3 composables use ref() for reactive state and computed() for derived state
  - useAuth() returns object with isAuthenticated, authenticate(), getPassword(), logout() methods
  - localStorage is used alongside ref state for persistence across page reloads
  - LoginView styling uses gradient background and centered form layout for professional appearance
  - Future components should call getPassword() when making API requests that need X-Auth-Password header

## Sun Jan 25 04:01 - US-009
- Implemented EditorLayout.vue component with header bar and responsive sidebar
- Layout features:
  - Header with app title 'Blog Editor' and space for header actions
  - Left sidebar 250px wide on desktop with proper flex layout
  - Main content area that fills remaining space
  - Mobile responsive design with sidebar collapse (< 768px viewport)
  - Sidebar toggle button for mobile devices
- Updated App.vue to use EditorLayout component with slot-based content
- Files created:
  - editor/src/layouts/EditorLayout.vue (responsive layout component)
- Files modified:
  - editor/src/App.vue (integrated EditorLayout, reorganized styles)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Layout components use Vue slots for flexible content injection (sidebar vs main content)
  - Responsive design uses computed() to track window width and breakpoints
  - CSS Grid/Flexbox combined for responsive header/sidebar/main layout
  - Mobile breakpoint convention: < 768px = mobile
  - On mobile, use fixed positioning for sidebar with transform animations for smooth collapse
  - Global App.vue styles (*, html, body) set baseline for full-height layouts
  - Sidebar should auto-collapse on mobile, auto-expand on desktop resize
