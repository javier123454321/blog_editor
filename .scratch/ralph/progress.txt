- Completed initialization of Vue 3 + TypeScript frontend project
- Verified strict mode, Vite config proxy, and placeholder template in App.vue
- Fixed workspace issue in root package.json by introducing 'workspaces' configuration
- Confirmed Vite dev server runs successfully on localhost:5173
- Files updated:
  - editor/src/App.vue
  - package.json (root for workspaces)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Ensure npm workspaces include subdirectories correctly to avoid dev server errors
  - Proxy configuration simplifies frontend-backend connection during development
